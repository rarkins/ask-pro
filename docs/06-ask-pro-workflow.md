# $ask-pro workflow

## End-to-end flow

```text
User or agent invokes $ask-pro
  ↓
Agent inspects repo and writes prompt
  ↓
ask-pro creates session folder
  ↓
ask-pro packages focused context
  ↓
ask-pro redacts secrets
  ↓
ask-pro opens/attaches ChatGPT browser
  ↓
If auth needed: NEEDS_USER_AUTH
  ↓
User logs in manually
  ↓
ask-pro resumes
  ↓
ask-pro selects Pro model/thinking if available
  ↓
ask-pro uploads CONTEXT.zip and submits prompt
  ↓
ask-pro waits with heartbeat/reattach
  ↓
ask-pro harvests markdown answer
  ↓
if --artifacts was requested, ask-pro downloads ask-pro-response.zip if generated
  ↓
Agent converts output into implementation plan
```

## Minimal agent invocation

The skill invocation is conceptually:

```text
$ask-pro <question/task>
```

The corresponding CLI should be:

```bash
ask-pro "<question/task>"
```

## Prompt ownership

The agent writes the prompt. `ask-pro` may validate the prompt and warn if it is too vague, but it should not replace the prompt with a rigid template.

## Prompt quality guidance

The CLI does not reject vague prompts today. Agents should still make prompts
specific before submission: name the decision question, constraints, files
attached, validation status, and expected output shape.

## Auth gate

Return `NEEDS_USER_AUTH` if any of these are detected:

- login page
- account selector
- MFA prompt
- CAPTCHA
- blocked session
- no composer visible after navigation

Never automate credentials.

## Wait budget

Default Pro wait budget:

```text
180 minutes
```

This is the tool patience budget, not a ChatGPT SLA.

If the browser disconnects, prefer reattach/harvest over resubmitting.

## Harvesting

Always write harvested markdown to:

```text
.ask-pro/sessions/<id>/ANSWER.md
```

If a generated zip is downloaded and valid, extract it to:

```text
.ask-pro/sessions/<id>/pro-output/
```

Then write:

```text
.ask-pro/sessions/<id>/PRO_OUTPUT_MANIFEST.json
```

If no zip exists, continue with markdown fallback.
