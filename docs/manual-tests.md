# Manual Tests

These checks exercise the real ChatGPT browser path. They are opt-in because
they open Chrome, use the signed-in ChatGPT account, and can take several
minutes or longer for Pro thinking.

## Prerequisites

- Node 24+.
- `pnpm install` completed.
- Headful Chrome available.
- ChatGPT login completed in the ask-pro browser profile:

  ```text
  ~/.agents/skills/ask-pro/browser-profile
  ```

- For agent-isolation checks, set `ASK_PRO_AGENT_ID` to a disposable value and
  expect the browser profile under
  `~/.agents/skills/ask-pro/agents/<id>-<hash>/browser-profile`.

- Do not click ChatGPT's `Answer now` button during Pro thinking. That skips the
  long-thinking path this tool is trying to preserve.
- Do not type or click in the launched Chrome window after submit. ChatGPT may
  focus its stop control while thinking; `ask-pro` tries to defocus it, but
  human input can still cancel the run.

## Local Checks

Run these before any live browser smoke:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test:ask-pro
pnpm run format:check
pnpm pack --dry-run
```

## Dry Run

Dry run creates the session files and context zip without opening ChatGPT.

```bash
pnpm start -- --dry-run --files src/ask-pro/session.ts "Review the ask-pro session skeleton."
```

Expected:

- A new `.ask-pro/sessions/<session-id>/` directory exists.
- `PROMPT.md`, `MANIFEST.md`, `MANIFEST.json`, `CONTEXT.zip`, and `status.json`
  exist.
- `status.json` reports a dry-run/prepared state.

## First Login / Auth Gate

Run a tiny prompt:

```bash
pnpm start -- "Return exactly ASK_PRO_BROWSER_LOGIN_READY."
```

If ChatGPT asks for login, MFA, or a challenge:

1. Complete it manually in the opened browser.
2. Leave the browser open.
3. Resume the printed session:

   ```bash
   pnpm start -- --resume <session-id>
   ```

Expected:

- The tool does not ask for credentials.
- The session records `NEEDS_USER_AUTH` or resumes to completion.
- `ANSWER.md` contains the exact requested phrase after completion.

## Fast Browser Smoke

Use this after touching browser launch, model selection, prompt submission,
attachment upload, answer harvest, or session persistence.

```bash
pnpm start -- --verbose --files README.md "Return exactly one line and nothing else: ASK_PRO_BROWSER_OK"
```

Expected:

- Chrome opens with the ask-pro profile.
- Fresh default runs open Temporary Chat first.
- ChatGPT stays in English UI if possible.
- The model picker can select the Pro path.
- If Temporary Chat hides Pro for the current account/UI, the run retries in
  normal ChatGPT.
- If the current ChatGPT UI shows Configure / `Pro thinking effort`, the run
  selects `Extended` when available.
- The top-right temporary-chat control does not confuse the run state.
- Upload logs show the context bundle was queued and uploaded.
- `ANSWER.md` contains `ASK_PRO_BROWSER_OK`.

## Response Zip Smoke

Use this when touching `src/ask-pro/responseZip.ts` or the post-answer browser
hook.

```bash
pnpm start -- --verbose --artifacts --files README.md "Return a short implementation package."
```

Expected:

- Markdown fallback always works: `ANSWER.md` exists.
- If ChatGPT exposes a `.zip` link, the session has:
  - `downloads/<file>.zip`
  - `pro-output/`
  - `PRO_OUTPUT_MANIFEST.json` with `responseZip.status = "downloaded"`
- If ChatGPT does not expose a zip link, the session still completes with
  `responseZip.status = "unavailable"`.
- Generated zip contents are not executed.

For an inline advisory run without `--artifacts`, `PRO_OUTPUT_MANIFEST.json`
should report `responseZip.status = "not_requested"`.
