# ask_pro

`ask_pro` is a browser-backed ChatGPT Pro escalation tool for coding agents.

It gives an agent a small command surface for the moments where a second opinion
is worth the wait: architecture calls, production-risk reviews, migrations,
debugging strategy, and implementation planning. The agent chooses the prompt
and context, `ask-pro` opens ChatGPT in a persistent browser profile, uploads the
bundle, waits for Pro, and stores the result in a project-local session.

```bash
ask-pro --no-temporary --files src --files tests "Review this implementation plan before I edit."
```

Status: pre-release. The CLI is usable from source, and the Codex plugin can be
installed from a local marketplace entry. The package is not published to npm
yet.

## What It Does

- Builds a focused `CONTEXT.zip` from files the agent explicitly selects.
- Uses a persistent Chrome profile so ChatGPT login stays human-controlled.
- Selects ChatGPT Pro with standard thinking by default.
- Supports `--extended` for deep, long-running Pro consults.
- Writes compact agent-readable telemetry on stdout.
- Harvests markdown answers by default.
- Extracts a generated response zip only when `--artifacts` is requested.

The coding agent still owns the work. `ask-pro` gets the consult; it does not
apply generated code or execute generated files.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm 10+
- A ChatGPT account with Pro access in the browser profile used by `ask-pro`

Authentication is deliberately manual. `ask-pro` never asks for, types, reads,
or logs passwords, MFA codes, recovery codes, session cookies, or raw auth
tokens.

## Install From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pimpmuckl/ask-pro.git
cd ask-pro
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm start -- "Return exactly ASK_PRO_OK."
```

For a shell-local binary:

```bash
pnpm link --global
ask-pro "Review the staged implementation plan."
```

An eventual `npm install -g ask_pro` would install the `ask-pro` CLI only. It
would not automatically register the Codex plugin unless Codex adds an npm-based
plugin installer or marketplace source.

## Install The Codex Plugin

The Codex plugin is what makes `$ask-pro` and `$ask-pro:ask-pro` appear in
Codex. Add this repo to your home marketplace file:

```text
~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
```

Example marketplace:

```json
{
  "name": "local",
  "interface": {
    "displayName": "Local Plugins"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "ask-pro",
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "../../Code/ask-pro"
      },
      "policy": {
        "installation": "AVAILABLE",
        "authentication": "ON_USE"
      },
      "category": "Productivity"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then enable the plugin in your Codex config:

```toml
[plugins."ask-pro@local"]
enabled = true
```

Use your marketplace name in place of `local` if your marketplace uses another
name. Restart or reload Codex; the skill list should include `$ask-pro` and
`$ask-pro:ask-pro`.

After changing plugin-facing files such as `README.md`,
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, or `skills/ask-pro/SKILL.md`, refresh the local
plugin cache from the repo source:

```bash
pnpm run plugin:refresh
```

The cache under `~/.codex/plugins/cache/...` is generated install state. Do not
edit or copy files there by hand. Agents should use the cached runner, not a
mutable development checkout, when `ask-pro` is not on `PATH`:

```bash
node "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache/<marketplace-name>/ask-pro/local/scripts/run-cached-cli.mjs" -- --cwd /path/to/repo --no-temporary --prompt-file question.md --files src
```

PowerShell equivalent:

```powershell
node "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\plugins\cache\<marketplace-name>\ask-pro\local\scripts\run-cached-cli.mjs" -- --cwd C:\path\to\repo --no-temporary --prompt-file question.md --files src
```

In cached-runner mode, `--files` must resolve inside `--cwd`. Prefer
repo-relative file paths.

## First Login

The default persistent browser profile lives at:

```text
~/.agents/skills/ask-pro/browser-profile
```

For ordinary single-agent use, leave `ASK_PRO_AGENT_ID` unset so runs reuse this
shared profile. For independent concurrent agents, set a stable reusable id:

```bash
ASK_PRO_AGENT_ID=review-t1 ask-pro --no-temporary "Review this migration plan."
```

That creates an isolated profile under:

```text
~/.agents/skills/ask-pro/agents/review-t1-<hash>/browser-profile
```

Each new profile may need a human login. If auth is required, `ask-pro` records
the session and prints a compact state with a resume command. Log in in the
opened browser, then resume:

```bash
ask-pro --resume <session-id>
```

On Windows, fresh runs for a managed Chrome profile start minimized after
`ask-pro` has recorded that profile as auth-ready from a completed run. First
login, resume/recovery, and stale-auth paths stay visible or are restored for
human action. Local managed Chrome also ignores accidental human input while Pro
is answering. If login, MFA, a browser challenge, or incomplete-answer debugging
needs human attention, `ask-pro` restores the retained browser.

## Temporary Chat

Fresh runs try ChatGPT Temporary Chat first:

```text
https://chatgpt.com/?temporary-chat=true
```

If the current account or UI does not expose Pro in Temporary Chat, `ask-pro`
automatically retries the fresh default run in normal ChatGPT. Use
`--temporary` only when Temporary Chat is required and fallback would be wrong.

For repo advisories, large bundles, review rounds, or anything where recovery
matters, prefer `--no-temporary`:

```bash
ask-pro --no-temporary --prompt-file question.md --files src
```

Temporary Chat sessions are less recoverable if the browser or tab is closed
before harvest. Non-temporary runs can surface a recoverable `conversation_url`
when ChatGPT provides one.

## Thinking Effort

Normal Pro thinking is the default. Use `--extended` only for difficult
architecture questions, production-risk reviews, or implementation-plan packages
where a multi-hour wait is acceptable:

```bash
ask-pro --extended --no-temporary --prompt-file architecture-question.md --files docs --files src
```

When ChatGPT labels the model row simply as `Pro`, `ask-pro` treats that as the
current Pro target. Exact dated model strings are only hints.

## Commands

```bash
ask-pro [options] [question...]
```

| Option                   | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--files <pattern>`      | Add a file, directory, or glob to the context bundle. Repeat as needed. |
| `--prompt-file <path>`   | Read the question from a UTF-8 file; use `-` for stdin.                 |
| `--artifacts`            | Ask for `ask-pro-response.zip` plus markdown fallback.                  |
| `--response-zip`         | Alias for `--artifacts`.                                                |
| `--dry-run`              | Create the session and `CONTEXT.zip` without opening ChatGPT.           |
| `--resume [session-id]`  | Resume the latest or selected prepared/waiting session.                 |
| `--status [session-id]`  | Show the latest or selected session status.                             |
| `--harvest [session-id]` | Print `ANSWER.md` only for answer-bearing sessions; else print status.  |
| `--copy [session-id]`    | Print `ANSWER.md` path for answer-bearing sessions, else status.        |
| `--extended`             | Request Extended Pro thinking for deep, multi-hour escalations.         |
| `--temporary`            | Require ChatGPT Temporary Chat; fail instead of falling back.           |
| `--no-temporary`         | Start or resume outside Temporary Chat.                                 |
| `--verbose`              | Print browser automation diagnostics.                                   |

Examples:

```bash
ask-pro --dry-run --files "src/**/*.ts" "Audit this slice for hidden coupling."
ask-pro --files src/ask-pro/session.ts --files tests/ask-pro "Find missing tests."
ask-pro --no-temporary --prompt-file question.md --files src --files tests
ask-pro --artifacts --prompt-file implementation-plan.md --files src
ask-pro --status
ask-pro --harvest <session-id>
```

Use `--prompt-file` for multiline prompts. This avoids shell quoting issues and
keeps the exact question in `PROMPT.md`.

`--files` accepts files, directories, and globs. Windows backslash paths and
absolute paths inside the project cwd are normalized into stable relative
manifest paths. For cross-repo calls, pass `--cwd <target-repo-root>` and keep
`--files` repo-relative to that cwd.

Add `.ask-pro/` to consuming repos' `.gitignore`. Session files are local run
artifacts and should not show up in normal diffs.

Keep context bundles focused: relevant source files, focused tests, docs that
define the contract, known recent changes, and validation status. Avoid
whole-repo bundles unless the question is explicitly broad architecture.

## Agent Output

`ask-pro` is agent-facing. Normal stdout is compact TOON-style telemetry;
browser progress and diagnostics go to stderr and session logs. `--harvest` is
the exception: it prints the raw markdown answer so agents can pipe or read the
Pro answer without metadata noise.

Example status output:

```toon
ask_pro
  session: 2026-05-02T192156-review-this
  state: dry_run_complete
  thinking: standard
  temporary: default
  action: resume
  resume: "ask-pro --resume 2026-05-02T192156-review-this"
  files: 1
```

Example auth gate:

```toon
ask_pro
  session: 2026-05-02T192156-review-this
  state: needs_auth
  reason: login_page_detected
  profile: shared
  profile_path: ~/.agents/skills/ask-pro/browser-profile
  chrome: launched
  language: "en-US,en"
  action: human_login_then_resume
  resume: "ask-pro --resume 2026-05-02T192156-review-this"
```

When known, status records may include `profile`, `profile_path`, `chrome`,
`language`, and `conversation_url`.

Generated response zips are harvested only for `--artifacts` /
`--response-zip` sessions. The wrapper does not ask for a zip by default. For
normal advisory runs, use `ask-pro --harvest <session-id>` to print the markdown
answer.

If a capture looks like a deferred-work preamble instead of a real answer,
`ask-pro` marks the session `INCOMPLETE_ANSWER` / `preamble_without_artifacts`.
Do not treat that as a completed consult. Try resume/harvest if recoverable;
otherwise rerun with `--no-temporary`, a tighter bundle, and a more direct
prompt.

During generation, `ask-pro` blocks browser input through CDP after submit so
accidental human input is less likely to activate ChatGPT's Stop control.

Useful advisory prompt starter:

```text
Return final markdown only. Do not answer with a preamble. Do not produce an implementation package. Rank findings by severity. Treat attached bundle as authoritative. Call out uncertainty.
```

## Sessions

Project-local session data lives in:

```text
.ask-pro/sessions/<session-id>/
```

Important files:

| File                            | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `PROMPT.md`                     | The prompt sent to ChatGPT Pro.                    |
| `MANIFEST.md` / `MANIFEST.json` | Context bundle inventory.                          |
| `CONTEXT.zip`                   | Redacted context uploaded to ChatGPT.              |
| `ANSWER.md`                     | Harvested markdown answer.                         |
| `browser.json`                  | Browser runtime metadata.                          |
| `status.json`                   | Session state and timestamps.                      |
| `downloads/`                    | Downloaded response zip, when ChatGPT exposes one. |
| `pro-output/`                   | Extracted generated response zip files.            |
| `PRO_OUTPUT_MANIFEST.json`      | Response zip status and extracted file metadata.   |

Generated session data is ignored by git.

## Response Zip

Markdown is the default output. If `--artifacts` / `--response-zip` is set and
the Pro answer exposes a `.zip` link, `ask-pro` downloads it in the browser
context, validates it, extracts it under `pro-output/`, and writes
`PRO_OUTPUT_MANIFEST.json`.

The expected generated zip contract is:

```text
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
TASKS.json
TEST_PLAN.md
RISK_REGISTER.md
FILES_TO_EDIT.md
REPO_CONTEXT_USED.md
```

`ask-pro` never executes generated zip contents.

## Validation

Fast local checks:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test:ask-pro
pnpm run format:check
pnpm pack --dry-run
```

Manual browser smokes are opt-in because they open a real ChatGPT session. See
`docs/manual-tests.md`.
